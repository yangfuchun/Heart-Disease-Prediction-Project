# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project

In this project we downloaded the dataset from a public database. There are in total >6000 records and 15+ medical parameters. We are trying to use Machine Learning (ML) to explore which factors most effectively predict whether a patient has 10-year coronary heart disease. 

The first step involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data better. The second step is about spliting the dataset into training sample and testing sample. Because the dependent variable is a binary variable, binomial logistics regression analysis is used. In the final model, 4 variables, both continuous and categorical, are included to acheive a 87% prediction accuracy rate.
